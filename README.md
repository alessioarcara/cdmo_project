## Encodings and Their Differences

### Pseudo-Boolean (PB) Encoding

PB encoding involves expressing constraints as linear inequalities over Boolean variables. These constraints are then converted into CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) using various encoding techniques. The complexity of PB encoding depends on the method used. For instance, PBAdder networks require multiple auxiliary variables and clauses, leading to increased computational overhead.

### DIMACS Format

- **Description**: DIMACS format is a standard text format for specifying SAT problems. It uses a specific syntax to define variables and clauses in CNF. Commonly used for input to SAT solvers, enabling the representation of large and complex SAT instances.

### SWC (Sequential Weight Counter) Encoding

- **Description**: SWC encoding preserves general arc consistency and is efficient in terms of the number of clauses and variables required. It uses O(nk) clauses and auxiliary variables. Compared to other encodings like BDD (Binary Decision Diagrams) or sorting networks, SWC is simpler and maintains consistency better, making it suitable for specific types of SAT problems.
